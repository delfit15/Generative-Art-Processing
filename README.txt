Generative art work with processing and pure data.
Interact with the images making sound.
Change your voice volume level, and when you like what you see, clap really loud to
go on to making other changes!

Its the tp_artegenerativo file.

I made this in 2020 for an assigment in Inform√°tica II, UNA Artes Multimediales.
